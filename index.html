Hello all! My name is Perri Specter, and I'm a recent graduate of Ringling College of Art and Design.
I majored in illustration because drawing/creating are my favorite things to do. I've been drawing
for as long as I can remember! Nowadays, my digital painting involves me to spend copius amounts of time
infront of my computer which ruins my ability to stand up straight. Good times!
